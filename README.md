# Terminal Battleships
this is a simple battleships game where you just try to guess where the enemy battleships, you do not have a board.
the symbol on screen will change from '?' to '*' if you destroyed and enmy ship and it will turn to '+' if you hit it but not destroyed it.
* (this is not a very safe or optimised, and will crash if you input the wrong info, and sometimes will crash on purpose if it can not fit all the ships on the board,
  this was how the project was meant to be acording to the teacher)
